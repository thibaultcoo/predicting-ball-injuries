# Predicting basketball injuries using ML
*Soughati Kenza, Henry-Biabaud Briac, Collin Thibault*, within the scope of the ```M203 Alternative finance class```

The aim of this project was to develop a model capable of predicting professionnal basketball player injuries, based on box score individual statistics from their latest games. *(last update: March 17th)*


*Data extraction*: we manually coded an extraction algorithm for all required statistics, alongside cleaning and enhancing segments to make the dataset usable.

```python
df_stats.sample(10)
```
